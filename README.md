# Cards against Humanity

Cards against humanity is a party card game where
players complete prompts using humorous, offensive or absurd answers. Players will be
shown a black card as a round starts, a single player is then randomly chosen “Card
Czar” while other players must submit their responses as white cards. The Card Czar
then chooses their favorite answer and the player with that card wins a point.
